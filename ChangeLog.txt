This merge primarily consisted of bug fixes.  Some amount of cleanup
was also done, primarily in the main VooDooDriver class.  The plugin
feature had its major replumbing finished.

   appending text

= Bugs Fixed =

 * 49296: Need a way to assert nothing is selected in the select list box

 * 51806: VDD - textarea accessor append text instead of overwritting
          text via the 'set' attribute
 * 51807: VDD - textarea accessor needs the 'clear' attribute

This merge updates VooDooDriver's plugin interface.  Now, instead of
passing individual arguments with "command-line" args, the element,
and the browser object, a single opaque object containing all useful
information is passed in.  See the javadocs for PluginInterface and
PluginData for more information.

= New Features =

 * Plugins now are passed PluginData with much more runtime information

= Bugs Fixed =

 * 50365: Please give plugins read-only access to Voodoo/Soda vars.
 * 50571: Ability to Fire a Plugin without requiring a SodaElement

= All Changes =

be6265c Add plugin access to the current test's name
c47b492 Add plugin access to VDD hijacks
acbc071 Add plugin access to Soda Vars
