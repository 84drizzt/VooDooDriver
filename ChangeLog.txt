The merge is mostly bug fixes, with a few minor enhancements.  Support

was made to upgrade to a more recent Selenium, but issue 3392 causes
many test scripts to fail.

This merge updates VooDooDriver's plugin interface.  Now, instead of
passing individual arguments with "command-line" args, the element,
and the browser object, a single opaque object containing all useful
information is passed in.  See the javadocs for PluginInterface and
PluginData for more information.

= New Features =

 * Plugins now are passed PluginData with much more runtime information

 * 50365: Please give plugins read-only access to Voodoo/Soda vars.
